            </span><br><br><br> 
            Algorithms are essentially a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. In the social media platforms, algorithms are primarily used to manage and filter the vast amount of content available, ensuring that users are shown material that is most relevant to their interests, behaviors, and interactions.
            <br><br>Social media algorithms take into account various factors such as the posts users like, share, the follow, the time they spend on different types of content. These data points help algorithms understand user preferences and behavior patterns.

        </span><br><br><br> 
        Echo chambers are environments where a person is exposed only to opinions and information that reinforce their own beliefs, leading to a narrow worldview. These are often created on social media platforms through the workings of algorithms that personalize content delivery. By tracking user interactions—what they like, share, and spend time on—algorithms curate content that aligns with these preferences, effectively isolating users from contrary viewpoints.
        <br><br>Algorithm, by design, optimize for engagement, which often means prioritizing content that provokes strong emotional responses, such as anger or fear. This can lead to an increase in more extreme content, as such material tends to keep users engaged longer. The result is a feedback loop where extreme views are amplified, further polarizing opinions and deepening the divisions within society.
